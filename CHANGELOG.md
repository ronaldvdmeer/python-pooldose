## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Shields.io Badges**: Added PyPI version, Python version, license, Pylint, Mypy, and Tests badges to README ([#38](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/38))

### Changed

- **README Restructure**: Split ~980-line README into compact overview + `docs/` folder ([#38](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/38))
  - README reduced to ~100 lines with quick start, CLI summary, and documentation index
  - Detailed docs moved to `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/cli.md`, `docs/examples.md`, `docs/mock-client.md`, `docs/ssl.md`, `docs/security.md`, `docs/type-hints.md`
- **Retry Delay**: Extracted retry delay as a `PooldoseClient` constructor parameter (`retry_delay`, default: 0.1s) ([#34](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/34))

### Fixed

- **Session Consistency**: `_get_core_params()` now uses shared `_get_session()` instead of creating a standalone session, ensuring correct session hand-over from Home Assistant ([#35](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/35))
- **Exception Handling**: Added broad exception fallback in `_get_core_params()` to catch unexpected errors like `UnicodeDecodeError` ([#36](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/36))
- **Async Host Check**: `check_host_reachable()` is now properly async ([#31](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/31))
- **JSON Parse Errors**: Fixed `JSONDecodeError` handling in `RequestHandler` methods ([#29](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/29))

### Enhanced

- **Test Coverage**: Added 16 new tests (160 total), all passing ([#30](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/30))
- **Code Quality**: PEP 8 multi-line `__init__` signatures, pylint score 10.00/10, mypy clean ([#32](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/32), [#33](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/33))
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Fixed MockPooldoseClient examples, API Reference, CLI docs, and device support table ([#38](https://github.com/lmaertin/python-pooldose/pull/38))

- **Code Quality**: All tests pass (123 total), mypy and pylint score 10.00/10

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- **Entity Type Refinement**: `flow_rate_value` renamed to `flow_rate`

## [0.7.9] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

## [0.7.7] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- **CLI Debug Flag**: New `--print-payload` option for debugging HTTP payloads
  - Usage: `pooldose --host 192.168.1.100 --print-payload`
- **Payload Debugging**: Added `debug_payload` parameter and `get_last_payload()` method
- **Enhanced Demo**: Updated `examples/demo.py` with payload inspection (only shows payloads when operations succeed)

## [7.5.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added

- Convenience setters on the client: `set_switch`, `set_number`, `set_select` to avoid fetching InstantValues manually.
 - Mock client: now returns and stores the concrete POST payload for inspection (via `inspect_payload` / `get_last_payload`) and provides the same convenience setters as the real client.
 - Updated `examples/demo.py` to demonstrate usage for both real and mock clients (mock prints payloads when `inspect_payload` is enabled).
 - **New Device**: Added support for VA DOS EXACT (Model PDPR1H1HAR1V1, FW FW539224)

### Changed

- `InstantValues.set_number` now pairs `minT`/`maxT` fields and sends them as a single `[min,max]` payload when applicable.
- `RequestHandler.set_value` now always uses arrays for all value types, even for single values (e.g., `[{"value": 7, "type": "NUMBER"}]`, `[{"value": "O", "type": "STRING"}]`).
 - Mock client behavior adjusted: tests/demos can opt-in to inspect payloads; tests were updated to expect payload inspection by default.

### Enhanced

- **Fix**: Removed Chlorine Sensor from PDPR1H1HAR1V0, as this is not supported.

### Fixed

- Tests updated to expect inspectable mock payloads by default; test suite now passes.
 - Updated demo and tests; full test suite currently passes (119 tests).
